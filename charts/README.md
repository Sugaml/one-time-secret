### One Time Secret Helm Charts

Helm charts are a combination of Kubernetes YAML manifest templates and helm-specific files. You can call it a helm package. Since the Kubernetes YAML manifest can be templated, you donâ€™t have to maintain multiple helm charts of different environments. Helm uses the go templating engine for the templating functionality.

## Create Chart 
```
    helm create onetime-secret
```

## Validate the Helm Chart
```
    helm lint .
    helm template .

```

## Deploy the Helm Chart
```
    helm install api-service onetime-secret

```

## Deploy the Helm Chart using values.yaml

```

    helm install onetime-secret onetime-secret --values env/prod-values.yaml

```


## Check the release
```

    helm list

```
## Helm Upgrade & Rollback
```

    helm upgrade onetime-secret onetime-secret
    helm rollback onetime-secret
    helm rollback <release-name> <revision-number>

```

### Uninstall The Helm Release
```

    helm uninstall onetime-secret

```
### Package the chart and deploy it to Github, S3, or any other platform
```
    helm package onetime-secret

```

*We can also use --dry-run command to check. This will pretend to install the chart to the cluster and if there will be some issue it will show the error.*
```
    helm install --dry-run my-release one-time-secret

```

## Debugging Helm Charts

We can use the following commands to debug the helm charts and templates.

    **helm lint**: This command takes a path to a chart and runs a series of tests to verify that the chart is well-formed.
    **helm get values**: This command will output the release values installed to the cluster.
    **helm install --dry-run**: Using this function we can check all the resource manifests and ensure that all the templated are working fine.
    **helm get manifest**: This command will output the manifests that are running in the cluster.
    **helm diff**: It will output the differences between the two revisions.

```

    helm diff revision onetime-secret 1 2

```

## Helm Chart Possible Errors

If you try to install an existing helm package, you will get the following error.

```

    Error: INSTALLATION FAILED: cannot re-use a name that is still in use

```

To update or upgrade the release, you need to run the upgrade command.

If you try to install a chart from a different location without giving the absolute path of the chart you will get the following error.

```
    Error: non-absolute URLs should be in form of repo_name/path_to_chart

```

To rectify this, you should execute the helm command from the directory where you have the chart or provide the absolute path or relative path of the chart directory.

## Helm Charts Best Practices

*Following are some of the best practices to be followed when developing a helm chart.*

    - Document your chart by adding comments and a README file as documentation is essential for ensuring maintainable Helm charts.
    - We should name the Kubernetes manifest files after the Kind of object i.e deployment, service, secret, ingress, etc.
    - Put the chart name in lowercase only and if it has more than a word then separate out with hyphens (-)
    - In values.yaml file field name should be in lowercase.
    - Always wrap the string values between quote signs.
    - Use Helm version 3 for simpler and more secure releases. Check this document for more details
